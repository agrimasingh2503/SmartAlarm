## What is SmartAlarm?

SmartAlarm is a [student-maintained project](README.md#-project-status) consisting of building a smart alarm system - which encompasses a range of `sensors` and `actuators` - to protect the usersâ€™ houses from intrusions. 

The system features a device which can be placed at a substantial spot in the house of the user and it will be enabled by the user in scenarios when either the user is away from their house or in a place where they would like to secure the house and be aware of any possible red signs.

### Main features

<details>
<summary>Intruder detection</summary>

>Whenever an intruder is detected, a red LED will be activated, the speaker will produce an alerting sound and a notification will be sent to a remote device to inform about the danger.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Anti-Tampering protection</summary>

>Detects whether someone is trying to move or damage the device itself by integrating a gyroscope sensor. A red LED and alerting speakers are activated immediately.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Activated device indicator</summary>

>Indicates that the vicinity is protected, signaling the owner and deterring would-be intruders. Uses a green LED.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Connection testing</summary>

>Check if the communication is working as intended, in which case clicking a physical button will allow users to ping the remote device.
